### Executive Summary

The TicketNest project aims to be an easy and efficient platform for event ticketing. It helps users, event organizers, and administrators work together to manage and attend events smoothly. The focus is on making the ticket-buying process simple and providing clear information about events. There are options to support accessibility so that everyone can join in. Users can get a more personalized experience by choosing their favorite event types and getting tailer-made notifications. Organizers can set up their events easily and track the performance metrics. Meanwhile, administrators help keep the platform safe, organized, and running well for all users.
